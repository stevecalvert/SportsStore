// I will be using the TypeScript compiler to generate the JavaScript files that will be executed by the browser.
// I will use type annotations throughout the SportsStore project because they help make the code easier to understand and 
// make some Angular features easier to use.
// The TypeScript compiler relies on type definition files to provide it with type information for JavaScript libraries that are not written in TypeScript. 
// Run the following commands in the SportsStore folder to download and install the type definition files required for this project:
// npm run typings -- install dt~core-js --save â€“global
// npm run typings -- install dt~node --save --global
// The typings package will get the latest type information for the Core-JS and Node packages and save them in a folder called typings. 
// It will also generate a file called typings.json
