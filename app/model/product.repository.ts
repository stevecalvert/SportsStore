/* The data source is responsible for providing the application with the data it requires, but access to that data is typically 
mediated by a repository, which is responsible for distributing that data to individual application building blocks so that the
details of how the data has been obtained are kept hidden.

When Angular needs to create a new instance of the repository, it will inspect the class and see that it needs a StaticDataSource 
object in order to invoke the ProductRepository constructor and create a new object.
The repository constructor calls the data sourceâ€™s getProducts method and then uses the subscribe method on the Observable object 
that is returned to receive the product data.
